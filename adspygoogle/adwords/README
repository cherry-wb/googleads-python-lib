AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API Python Client Library
===================================================================

Google's AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange API service lets developers design
computer programs that interact directly with the AdWords and DoubleClick Ad
Exchange platform. With these applications, advertisers and third parties can
more efficiently -- and creatively -- manage their large or complex AdWords and
DoubleClick Ad Exchange accounts and campaigns.

AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange API Python Client Library makes it easier to
write Python clients to programmatically access AdWords and DoubleClick Ad
Exchange accounts. One of the main features of this client library is that it
hides SOAP layer from end user, which makes it much easier to interact with API.
The outgoing and incoming SOAP messages are monitored and logged on demand. The
response headers like responseTime, units, requestId, etc. can also be logged on
demand. Another nice feature of this client library is that it handles data
types for all API call parameters. All variables are passed in as either dict,
list, or str. The conversion to the right type is handled internally by the
client library. Each client instance keeps track of its own number of API units
and operations consumed during the program run.

Starting with 15.0.0, the client library uses a patched version of the SOAPpy
web services toolkit from http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/, which is included
in the tarball download. This change allows us to write more consistent and
maintainable code, including unit tests and code examples.

This change also includes fixes to make SOAPpy follow the WSDL when returning
objects. For example, when an element is defined in the WSDL with maxOccurs > 1,
this is traditionally represented as a list (SOAPpy would return back a list of
elements when more than one element is present in the response). However, when
only a single element is returned in the response, SOAPpy used to return back
just the element, not the element wrapped in a list. Starting with 15.0.0, it
will correctly return back a list with a single element.

Multiple modules are supported for parsing SOAP XML messages. By default, the
client library uses the PyXML module in order to parse SOAP XML messages. In
addition, the SOAPpy library supports ElementTree module, which may be activated
simply by setting the appropriate config value (i.e. config['xml_parser']).
Also, if you have Python v2.5+, the ElementTree comes with it. The cElementTree
module is now also supported.

The code examples, located in "examples/", demonstrate how to use the client
library. For additional examples, take a look at the unit tests in "tests/".

Useful scripts are located in "scripts/" directory.

The documentation was generated using Epydoc, a nice tool for generating API
documentation for Python modules, and is located in "docs/".

The client library includes a set of unit tests and integration tests located in
"tests/". All integration tests should be executed using test accounts if
possible. Whenever changes are made to the client library, the appropriate unit
test should be executed to make sure that everything is working as intended and
no new bugs were introduced.


Announcements and updates
-------------------------

For API and client library updates and news, please follow our Google+ Ads
Developers page:

How do I start?
---------------

Start by making sure that you have Python installed on your machine. If you
don't have one already, sign up for a Google Account at
https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount. Once that's taken care of, proceed
to the step-by-step guide below. Write some code and enjoy!


Step-by-step guide for accessing the API using test accounts:
-----------------------------------------

1) Make sure you have Python v2.4 or above installed. The latest stable version
   can be fetched from http://www.python.org/.

2) Follow the directions for creating an AdWords test account located at:
   https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/test-accounts

3) Install or update the library from PyPI. If you're using pip, this is as easy
   as:

   $ pip install [--upgrade] adspygoogle

   If you don't want to install directly from PyPI, you can download the library
   as a tarball and then install it manually. The download can be found here:
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/adspygoogle
   Navigate to the directory that contains your downloaded unzipped client
   library and run the "setup.py" script to install the "adspygoogle"
   module.

   $ python setup.py build install

4) From the scripts/adspygoogle/adwords directory, run the "config.py" script to
   set authentication headers. More information about the format of each header
   is available at: https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/headers
   Example,

   OAuth 2.0 client ID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   OAuth 2.0 client secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   OAuth 2.0 refresh token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   Login client customer id: 123-456-7890
   User agent: GoogleTest
   Developer token: ABcdeFGH93KL-NOPQ_STUv

   Select XML parser [1=PyXML, 2=ElementTree]: 1
   Enable debugging mode [y/n]: n
   Enable SOAP XML logging mode [y/n]: y
   Enable API request logging mode [y/n]: y

5) Read over the documentation in
   https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/index to familiarize yourself
   with the API of the client library.
