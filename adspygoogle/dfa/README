DoubleClick for Advertisers API Python Client Library
=====================================================

The DoubleClick for Advertisers (DFA) API lets developers to build applications
that interact directly with the DFA platform and perform a variety of
trafficking and administrative tasks. It is particularly useful for automating
recurring processes and for integrating DoubleClick for Advertisers with
third-party systems.

The DoubleClick for Advertisers (DFA) API is an API to manage your DFA account.
Advertisers use DFA to create and organize campaigns consisting of hundreds or
thousands of graphic ads, to serve these ads to specific websites, and to
generate a variety of reports tracking cost, impressions, and clickthroughs.

DoubleClick for Advertisers API Python Client Library makes it easier to write
Python clients to programmatically access DFA accounts. One of the main features
of this client library is that it hides SOAP layer from the end user, which
makes it much easier to interact with API. The outgoing and incoming SOAP
messages are monitored and logged on demand. The response headers like
responseTime, requestId, etc. can also be logged on demand. Another nice feature
of this client library is that it handles data types for all API call
parameters. You no longer need to remember that Placement ID is of type long and
placementType is int. Both of these variables can now be sent as simple strings
when passing them as parameters. In fact, all variables are passed as either
dict, list, or str. The conversion to the right type is handled internally by
the client library.

The client library provides support for SOAPpy a well known web services
toolkit from http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/. The client library will take
care of proper type conversions, instantiation of classes, etc.

Two modules are supported for parsing SOAP XML messages. By default, the client
library uses the PyXML module in order to parse SOAP XML messages. In addition,
the library also supports ElementTree module, which may be activated simply by
setting the appropriate config value (i.e. config['xml_parser']). Note that if
you already have an lxml module installed and wish to use ElementTree, you do
not need to install ElementTree. The lxml module is mostly compatible with
ElementTree. Also, if you have Python v2.5+, the ElementTree comes with it. The
cElementTree module is now also supported.

Although, there are projects out there that still support PyXML, it is no longer
maintained. The last update for ElementTree library is dated 2007-09-12. Out of
these three libraries, the lxml is the one that was updated most recently.

PLEASE NOTE: Using ElementTree as your XML parser will cause your outgoing SOAP
logs to not exactly match the XML that is actually being sent. For this reason,
PyXML is strongly recommended.

The code examples, located in "examples/", demonstrate how to use the client
library. For additional examples, take a look at the unit tests in "tests/".

Useful scripts are located in "scripts/" directory.

The documentation was generated using Epydoc, a nice tool for generating API
documentation for Python modules, and is located in "docs/".

The client library includes a set of unit tests located in "tests/". All unit
tests are (and should be) executed against the test environment. Whenever
changes are made to the client library, the appropriate unit test should be
executed to make sure that everything is working as intended and no new bugs
were introduced.


Announcements and updates

How do I start?
---------------

Start by making sure that you have Python installed on your machine. Once that's
taken care of, proceed to the step-by-step guide below. Write some code and
enjoy!


Step-by-step guide for accessing the DoubleClick network:
---------------------------------------------

1) If you don't currently have a DoubleClick for Advertisers account, contact
   DoubleClick sales to look into accessing the network. You can reach them at
   http://www.google.com/doubleclick/contact/advertisergeneral.html

2) Request API access if your DFA account is not currently API-enabled at
   http://www.google.com/support/dfa/bin/request.py?contact_type=dfa6api

3) Make sure you have Python v2.4 or above installed. The latest stable version
   can be fetched from http://www.python.org/.

4) Install or update the library from PyPI. If you're using pip, this is as easy
   as:

   $ pip install [--upgrade] adspygoogle

   If you don't want to install directly from PyPI, you can download the library
   as a tarball and then install it manually. The download can be found here:
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/adspygoogle
   Navigate to the directory that contains your downloaded unzipped client
   library and run the "setup.py" script to install the "adspygoogle"
   module.

   $ python setup.py build install

5) From the scripts/adspygoogle/dfa directory, run the "config.py" script to set
   authentication headers. More information about the format of each header is
   at https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/docs/SOAP_headers
   Example,

   Your DFA account's username: JoeShmoe@dfa
   OAuth 2.0 client ID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   OAuth 2.0 client secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   OAuth 2.0 refresh token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

   Select XML parser [1=PyXML, 2=ElementTree]: 1
   Enable debugging mode [y/n]: n
   Enable SOAP XML logging mode [y/n]: y
   Enable API request logging mode [y/n]: y
   Enter an application name: companyName-programName

6) Read over the documentation in "docs/index.html" to familiarize yourself with
   the API of the client library.
